# Hisogram_NER_OpenMP

This project is a parallel implementation in C++ with OpenMP of the creation of Histograms relative to named entities occurrences in tweets. For NER (Name Entity Recognition) has been used MITIE library (https://github.com/mit-nlp/MITIE).

To run this project is necessary to download the ner_model from MITIE library. It is not possible upload on Github this file, because it exceeds the maximum file size of 100 MB.

In the C++ code, some absolute path have been used to load data from directories: to run this code is necessary to change all these path.
